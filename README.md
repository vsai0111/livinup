# LivinUp

Personalised shopping discovery and price intelligence.

LivinUp learns what you like, surfaces products that match, and tells you whether
today's price is genuinely a good moment to buy — using recorded price history
rather than marketing claims. When it does not have enough data to judge, it
says so.

Phase 1 is a discovery and decision layer. It is not a marketplace, a checkout,
or a payment platform.

---

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and create an account. **No database server, no
Docker, and no credentials are needed.**

On first run the app starts an embedded PostgreSQL, applies its migrations, and
seeds a catalogue of ~46 products across 3 merchants with ~3,100 price
observations — in about four seconds.

## The loop

```
preferences ─► discovery ─► understanding ─► price intelligence
     ▲                                              │
     └────────── behavioural signal ◄── user action ┘
```

Everything else is secondary to making that loop work well.

## What is real, and what is not

| **Product catalogue**                                  | **Seeded.** No merchant feed has been contracted                                                 |
| **Supabase Auth path**                                 | Complete and type-checked, but **never run against a live project** — no credentials provisioned |
| **PostHog / Sentry**                                   | Not configured. Both degrade to no-ops with structured logging                                   |

Brands and merchants in the seed catalogue are fictional. Prices are synthetic,
and every seeded price observation is marked `source = 'seed'` so it stays
distinguishable from real data — see [docs/product-data.md](docs/product-data.md).

## Product principles

These are enforced in code, not just stated:

- **Never claim what the data does not support.** No "best price" or "lowest
  price" — LivinUp only sees the merchants it has ingested. A deal band is not
  rendered at all when price history is too thin.
- **Never fabricate history.** Absent statistics render as "—", not as a guess.
- **Explain every recommendation.** The product page lists which preferences
  matched, which did not, and the full weighted score breakdown.
- **Everything inferred is visible and deletable.** The preferences page shows
  every belief LivinUp holds, its weight, and where it came from.
- **A wrong product match is worse than a missing one.** Matching is exact-key
  only.
