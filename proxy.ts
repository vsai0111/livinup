 *      get the sign-in screen instead of a wasted render.
 *   2. Keep the Supabase Auth session cookie fresh, when Supabase is configured.
 *
 * What it does NOT do is authorise. It only checks that a session cookie is
 * *present*, never that it is valid — validation needs Node crypto and a
 * database lookup. Real authorisation happens in app/(app)/layout.tsx via
 * `requireUser()`. Treating middleware as the access-control boundary is how a
 * mistake in the `matcher` below silently exposes every page beneath it; here,
 * a broken matcher costs a redirect, not a data leak.
