 * The production request path, run as it runs on Vercel.
 *
 * `GET /` reaches `getDb()`, which on a deployment with no `DATABASE_URL`
 * resolves to the embedded driver. Previously that driver called
 * `mkdir('.livinup/pgdata')`, which resolves against `process.cwd()` — the
 * read-only deployment bundle — and produced `ENOENT: mkdir '.livinup'` on every
 * request.
 *
 * This test stands in a fake, empty project root and asserts that connecting
 * under a serverless runtime both works and leaves that root untouched.
